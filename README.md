# AI Applications

This is a repository where I host my public-facing AI applications. I'm learning as I go, so expect things to evolve over time as I explore new ideas and improve on existing ones.

In my role as Field CTO at SoftServe, I regularly advise clients on AI and emerging technologies. I believe in having genuine hands-on experience with the things I talk about, so this is where I build and experiment, not just to learn, but to stay grounded in the practical realities of the tools and approaches I recommend.
