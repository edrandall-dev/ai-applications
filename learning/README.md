# Learning

This folder contains scripts written while learning LangGraph fundamentals. These are not applications — they are exercises to understand how graphs, nodes, edges, and state work before building the real thing.

## Files

- `hello.py` — a minimal LangGraph graph with a single node, used to understand the basic structure
- `number.py` — a multi-node graph that performs arithmetic on a number as it passes through state, used to understand how state is read and written by each node
